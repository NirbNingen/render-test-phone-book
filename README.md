# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Backend

The frontend is ready to use any backend hosted under port 3001

And all setup for the backend available at Render.com:

https://render-test-phone-book.onrender.com

The frontend is served on PORT 8081
The backend is served on PORT 5000

The frontend is packaged into the backend and served from there.
